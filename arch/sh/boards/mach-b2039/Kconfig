	help
	  It is possible to use either MII or RMII to communicate with
	  the IC+101 Ethernet PHY mounted inside the STxH207. Use this
	  option to select the desired protocol. This must match the
	  jumper setting on the board:
			MII	RMII (ext clk)	RMII (no ext clk)
		 J30	remove	1-2		2-3
		 J37	1-2	2-3		remove
		 J38	remove	2-3		2-3

	  Select the appropriate Ethernet PHY card.
	  This controls the Ethernet connection mode with the PHY, and
	  the corrisponding pad allocation and configuration.

config STM_B2039_CN14_NONE
	bool "None"
	help
	  No Ethernet card is plugged into CN14 of the B2039.

	help
	  B2032 Ethernet card on CN14 of B2039.

	  Note in order to continue using UART10 it will be necessary
	  to remove R256.

	bool "Use PIO3[0] as a PHY reset signal"
	default y
	help
	  Set this option to use PIO3[0] as a PHY reset signal. This requires
	  fitting J35 in position 1-2 (which prevents the use of this pin
	  as SBC_SYS_CLK_IN), and also disconnecting CN12 (which prevents
	  the use of UART11). This also conflicts with the keyscan and
	  PWM10 use of this pin.
